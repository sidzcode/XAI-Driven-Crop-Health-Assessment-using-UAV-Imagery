# XAI-Driven-Crop-Health-Assessment-using-UAV-Imagery
In this project, we have developed a robust Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model designed to classify UAV images of crops as either diseased or non-diseased. The CNN model is trained on a large dataset of UAV images and is optimized for high accuracy in disease detection.
